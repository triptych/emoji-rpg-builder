# Emoji RPG Builder - Task List

## Current Progress (March 8, 2025)
âœ… Completed breaking down the emoji-data.js file into smaller sub-files with a manifest file to improve performance and maintainability.
âœ… Completed Phase 2: Emoji Palette and Canvas implementation.
âœ… Completed Phase 3: Layer System implementation.
âœ… Completed Phase 4: Behavior System implementation.
âœ… Completed Phase 5: Game Engine Core implementation.
âœ… Completed Phase 6: Save/Load System implementation.
âœ… Completed Phase 7: Game Player implementation.
ðŸ”„ Partially completed Phase 8: Advanced Features implementation (4/6 tasks completed).

The emoji data has been restructured as follows:
- Created separate files for each emoji category in the js/emoji-data/ directory
- Implemented a manifest file (js/emoji-data/index.js) that imports and combines all categories
- Updated the original emoji-data.js to import from the new modular structure

This modular approach will make the codebase more maintainable and improve performance by allowing for lazy-loading of emoji categories in the future.

The Emoji Palette and Canvas implementation includes:
- Emoji selection palette with category filtering
- Search functionality for finding specific emojis
- Drag-and-drop functionality for placing emojis
- Canvas with grid system for precise placement
- Selection and manipulation of placed emojis
- Delete functionality for removing emojis
- Refactored code to use ES6 modules for better organization

The Layer System implementation includes:
- Layer management UI with add/delete controls
- Layer creation and deletion functionality
- Layer visibility toggling
- Drag-and-drop layer reordering
- Layer-specific properties (visibility, locked status)
- Default background and gameplay layers

The Behavior System implementation includes:
- Behavior assignment UI with modal dialog
- Six basic behavior types:
  - Static (non-moving objects)
  - Player-controlled (keyboard/touch input)
  - AI-controlled (patrol, circle, random patterns)
  - Collectible (score, health, speed boost effects)
  - Obstacle (solid/non-solid properties)
  - Trigger (win, lose, next level, teleport actions)
- Behavior property editors for each type
- Behavior preview in player mode

The Game Engine Core implementation includes:
- Game loop architecture with requestAnimationFrame
- Canvas-based rendering system
- AABB collision detection system
- Keyboard, mouse, and touch input handling
- Game state management (running, paused, score, time)
- Event system for behavior interactions
- Physics properties (gravity, friction)

The Save/Load System implementation includes:
- JSON-based game format for data serialization
- Local storage integration for saving/loading games
- File export/import functionality for sharing games
- Game metadata support (title, author, description)
- Current game state persistence
- Game settings modal for metadata editing

The Game Player implementation includes:
- Integrated game player with editor/player mode toggle
- Game loading from JSON data
- Play, pause, and reset controls
- Fullscreen mode for immersive gameplay
- Game completion detection via trigger behaviors
- Custom event system for game state changes

The Advanced Features implementation includes:
- Game properties editor (gravity, friction, dimensions)
- Scoring system with collectible items
- Win/lose conditions via trigger behaviors
- Game state transitions (next level, teleport)
- Remaining to implement: sound effects and animation system
